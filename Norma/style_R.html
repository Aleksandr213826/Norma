<h1 class="new5">Are Russian forces getting ready for war in Ukraine?</h1>

<img  class="black" src="images/svyatogor.jpg" width="200" height="310" alt="святогор">

<p>Despite a series of talks 
involving Russia and the West, it remains unclear and the fear of invasion 
remains.</p>

<p>Russia seized part of southern Ukraine in 2014 and backed separatists who 
started a conflict in large areas of the east.</p>

<p>Now Russia is warning of military <a href="http://www.hovtocorp.com/typepilot" target="blank" title="Программа type pilot">http://www.hovtocorp.com/typepilot</a>measures if the West does not meet its 
demands, and the US fears it could create a pretext to invade.</p>

<p>Why is Ukraine under threat?</p>
<p class="new4">Ukraine shares borders with both the EU and Russia, but as a former Soviet
 republic it has, and Russian is widely 
spoken there.</p>

<p class="new2">Russia has long resisted Ukraine's move towards European institutions and it 
is now demanding it never joins Nato, a demand rejected by the Western 
alliance.</p>

<p>It was when Ukrainians deposed their pro-Russian president in early 2014 that
 Russia moved in, seizing and annexing Ukraine's southern Crimean peninsula.
 Russian-backed separatists then captured large swathes of Ukraine's two 
eastern regions collectively known as the Donbas.</p>


<h2 class="new">How big is the risk of invasion?</h2>

<li>Conflict between rebels and Ukraine's military has continued to this day, 
although a shaky ceasefire is in place.</li>

<li>But it is the Russian forces operating beyond the Ukrainian border that are of
 most concern. Western intelligence services say they number up to 100,000.</li>

<li>The risk of a conflict is real, says Nato's secretary general. But it does not
 appear imminent.</li>
